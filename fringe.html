        <p>
          In tradition with other
          <a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/fringe/">FOSS events</a> there are a
          couple of events on the "Fringe" of Config Management Camp.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the same venue as Config Management Camp we are hosting:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#foreman">Foreman Construction Day</a></li>
            <li><a href="#puppet">Puppet Contributors Summit</a></li>

        <h2>Foreman Construction Day</h2>
        <a name="foreman"></a>
        <h3>Wednesday, February 7, 10:00 - 16:30, Room TBD</h3>

        <p>
          Foreman will be holding its third Foreman Construction Day on
          Wednesday 7th February 2018, which is the day after Config Management
          Camp.
        </p>

        <p>
          The aim is to build upon on the previous 2-4 days of talks and
          discussions, and put it to use! We're open to all members of our
          community, such as

          <ul>
            <li>New users looking for help getting started with Foreman</li>
            <li>Users looking to start contributing</li>
            <li>Code contributors to any of the core projects</li>
            <li>Puppet coders for the installer</li>
            <li>Plugin authors (new or existing plugins)</li>
            <li>Translators / documentors</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a great opportunity to get (more) involved in the community,
          and spend some face-to-face hack time with other Foreman devs. Hope to
          see you there!

        <h2>Habitat Workshop</h2>
        <a name="habitat"></a>
        <h3>Wednesday, February 7, 10:00 - 16:30, Room TBD</h3>

        <p>
          <a href="https://www.habitat.sh/">Habitat</a> is application
          automation that enables modern application teams to build, deploy, and
          manage any application in any environment - from traditional
          data-centers to containerized microservices.
        </p>

        <p>
          This workshop will provide attendees with the knowledge required to
          package and run applications with Habitat. At the end of this workshop
          attendees will understand Habitat’s packaging technology, how to
          package an existing application with Habitat, the benefits of the
          Habitat studio, how the Habitat supervisor works to provides
          application focused automation, and how to run applications using
          Habitat.
        </P>

        <p>
          We’ll break into small, self-selected working groups to take an
          application or service of your choice and habitize it. If your laptop
          already has a working Habitat and Docker setup, awesome! If not,
          no problem -- we’ll have a breakout group to get you going.
        </p>

        <p>
          No Habitat experience is required!  We'll introduce you to the
          concepts and get you some time with hands-on Habitat.
