        <p>
          In tradition with other
          <a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/fringe/">FOSS events</a> there are a
          couple of events on the "Fringe" of Config Management Camp.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the same venue as Config Management Camp we are hosting:
          <ul>

        <h2>Foreman Construction Day</h2>
        <h3>Wednesday, February 7, 10:00 - 16:30, Room TBD</h3>

        <p>
          Foreman will be holding its third Foreman Construction Day on
          Wednesday 7th February 2018, which is the day after Config Management
          Camp.
        </p>

        <p>
          The aim is to build upon on the previous 2-4 days of talks and
          discussions, and put it to use! We're open to all members of our
          community, such as

          <ul>
            <li>New users looking for help getting started with Foreman</li>
            <li>Users looking to start contributing</li>
            <li>Code contributors to any of the core projects</li>
            <li>Puppet coders for the installer</li>
            <li>
              Plugin authors (new or existing plugins)
              <a name="puppet"></a>
            </li>
            <li>Translators / documentors</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a great opportunity to get (more) involved in the community,
          and spend some face-to-face hack time with other Foreman devs. Hope to
          see you there!
        </p>

        <h2>Habitat &amp; InSpec Hackday</h2>
        <h3>Wednesday, February 7, 10:00 - 16:30, Room TBD</h3>

        <p>
          <a href="https://www.habitat.sh/">Habitat</a> is a simple, flexible
          way to build, deploy, and manage cloud native applications.
          <a href="https://www.inspec.io/">InSpec</a> is an open-source testing
          framework for infrastructure with a human-readable language for
          specifying compliance, security and other policy requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will break into small, self-selected working groups to hack on
          habitizing an application, using InSpec to validate a system, or other
          automation-related projects of your choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          No Habitat or InSpec experience is required!  It is not necessary to
          install anything in advance but you will be able to get going sooner
          if you have already installed the
          <a href="https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk">Chef Development Kit</a>,
          <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, and
          <a href="https://www.habitat.sh/tutorials/download/">Habitat</a>.  We
          will introduce you to the concepts and get you some time with hands-on
          Habitat and/or InSpec.

        <h2>Container Troubleshooting Workshop with Sysdig</h2>
        <h3>Wednesday, February 7, 10:00 - 15:00, Room TBD</h3>
        <p>
          Please register <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/container-troubleshooting-workshop-with-sysdig-cfgmgmtcamp-tickets-27757224606?aff=emea">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Join <a href="https://www.sysdig.com">Sysdig</a> for a 4-hour use-case
          driven training session on container visibility, troubleshooting and
          run-time security monitoring with the
          <a href="https://www.sysdig.org">Sysdig open source tools</a> (Sysdig,
          Sysdig Inspect, and Falco) and learn how containers work under the hood.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Agenda</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Visibility and troubleshooting</strong> (~1h) - Learn how to debug a 502 error on a containerized LB with HAproxy, a Python webapp crashing after working for 5 minutes, and where did you configure wrong credentials in a microservices app?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Analyzing performance and bottlenecks</strong> (~1h) - Compare for yourself the performance of different web servers running in containers, use system call tracing to find the bottleneck in your application or learn how to use spectrograms (flame graphs) to visualize system call performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Debugging Kubernetes</strong> (~1h) - Dive into Kubernetes internals using reverse engineering: why that Kubernetes service is valid but doesn't work? How does service resolution work? Or how Kubernetes instructs Docker Engine.
            </li>
            <a name="ansible"></a>
            <li>
              <strong>Security run-time monitoring and forensics</strong> (~1h) - Last but not least, all these previous lessons can also be applied for security, not only doing forensics on an attack attempt. <a href="https://www.sysdig.org/falco">Sysdig Falco</a> can alert on containers with anomalous behavior.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Ansible Lightbulb Workshop</h2>

          Ansible Essentials Hands-On Workshop<br>
          <u>Scenario</u>:<br>
          Providing hands-on instruction on the core essentials to students with limited experience automating with Ansible on linux servers.<br>
          <u>Run Time</u>:<br>
          4 Hours<br>
          <br>
          This module is designed to provide students with direct introductory instruction and guidance to beginning to automate with Ansible.
          It is the starting point for students intent on becoming more proficient with Ansible through other Lightbulb modules and their own usage.
          It is ideal for addressing small to medium size audiences of students that are committed to learning how to automate with Ansible.
          This module is the 2 hour workshop with a bit of extra depth and hands-on workshops.
          Delivering this module means providing each student with a lab environment and depending on the size and skill-level of the students
           in your audience, having one or more assistants to help students during the workshops.<br>
          <br>

        <h2>CFEngine and IoT hackathon</h2>
        <h3>Wednesday, February 7, 10:30-16:00, Room TBD</h3>
        <h3>Interested in Configuration Management or IoT? Join us!</h3>

        <p>
          We plan to hack on various projects and we want to discuss how to pave the way for the next 25 years of systems configuration.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working on your own project; have questions, or just visiting? You are always welcome. Our core devs are here, and everyone is happy to help others.<br>
          One thing we will work on is IoT - We already found out it's easy to interface CFEngine and IoT devices.<br></br> In the workshop we will start adding support for additional message queues and explore what we can do with this flexiblity and speed.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Come up with more ideas for combining IoT devices and system policy</li>
          <li>Learn more about CFEngine, advanced message queues and truly dynamic policies across autonomous systems</li>
          <li>Learn more about and contribute to exitsting policy frameworks and libraries</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Food and drinks will be provided.
