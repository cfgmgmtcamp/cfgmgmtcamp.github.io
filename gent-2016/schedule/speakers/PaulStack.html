        <h1>The Quest for Infrastructure Management 2.0</h1>
        <h3>Paul Stack</h3>
        <h3>UPDATED DATE/TIME/LOCATION</h3>
        <h3>Future Tooling - Tuesday: 01/Feb/2016 11:00 - B3.019</h3>
        <p>The age old task of racking and stacking in a physical data centre is becoming more and more rare as more companies embrace the public cloud. Having the ability to chose between providers such as AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean and Google Cloud Platform makes creating infrastructure easy. It is better to spend time developing better services for our customers than managing infrastructure
        
        </p><p>
        During this talk, Paul will demonstrate how building a scalable infrastructure on AWS becomes easy with Terraform. The talk will demonstrate how using configuration management, pre-baked AMIs and auto-scaling groups it gives the ability for developers to be able to launch their own infrastructure when needed. The demo’s will include the ability to launch instances, databases and manage user access
        
        </p><p>
        By the end of the talk, Paul will have demonstrated that the creation of infrastructure now becomes part of the development lifecycle and that the old ways of system administration is fast moving to become infrastructure engineering. Paul will also demonstrate that the creation of new ‘environments’ are just a change of parameters in our infrastructure code</p>
        </p>
