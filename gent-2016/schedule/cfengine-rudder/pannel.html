        <h1>CFEngine Champions Pannel</h1>
        <h3>Bas van der Vlies, Marco Marongiu, Martin Simons, Nick Anderson - Monday, February 1, 14:00-14:40 - B3.036</h3>
        <p>
        Have questions about CFEngine? Come and chat with the CFEngine Champions panel. Ask your design and policy questions or brainstorm with us on new ideas.

        <h2>About Bas van der Vlies</h2>
        <p>
          <img src='../../images/bas_van_der_vlies.png' width='150' height='150' style='float:right; padding-left:20px;' />
          Bas is passionate about IT automation and he is active on many open source projects such as sali, pxeconfig, pbs_python, and email2trac. He has embraced CFEngine as early as 1996 and, among other things, has contributed to the CFEngine parser. Last year the CFEngine team has invited Bas to Oslo to improve the reporting of syntax errors in the configuration files. He has also been a tremendous help within the Debian team to ensure that the Debian repository gets up to date CFEngine builds. Bas lives in Amsterdam and besides computers he likes traveling, music, sports (cycling, squash, snowboarding and speed skating) and walking on the beach with his dogs.

        <h2>About Marco Marongiu</h2>
        <p>
          <img src='../../images/marco_marongiu.jpg' width='150' height='150' style='float:right; padding-left:20px;' />
	  Marco became passionate about computers as a kid, as soon as he could put his hands on his cousin’s Commodore VIC20. He fell in love with cfengine in the early 2000’s, after reading about it in a book.
	  He started his career as a System Administrator in a Research Center in 1999, moved to an Italian ISP in 2003, and a Regional Government Agency in 2008. Finally, he left his beloved island of Sardinia, and moved to Norway in 2010, where he currently works as a Senior System Administrator for Opera Software ASA in Oslo.
	  He co-founded one of the first LUGs in Italy (the GULCh), and is the author of several technical articles, a Free Software advocate, a Perl and cfengine enthusiast, and many other things that it would be too much to mention.
	  He has a degree in Mathematics that he keeps hidden in a secret place.

        <h2>About Martin Simons</h2>
        <p>
          <img src='../../images/Martin-Simons.png' width='150' height='150' style='float:right; padding-left:20px;' />
	  Martin initiated the Debian-team in June 2013 and as a result we are now having an up to date and state of the art Debian Standards compliant CFEngine3 3.6.2. in the Debian Jessie repository.

	  He did the successful CFEngine Enterprise implementation at DirecTV in the beginning of 2014. He now is the driving force behind The CFEngine Roadshow, the open source show case of a complete CFEngine solution. He is a member of the International CFEngine Community support team.

	  He is happily living with his wife being a proud father of three daughters who left home to study at universities all over the country. The opportunity is to be able to spend more CFEngine time!
