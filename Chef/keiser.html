        <p>
          Your important new distributed application is a month from the go-live
          date.  Developers have carefully built it up, piece by piece, with
          fault tolerance designed in.  It has been performance optimized, and
          unit tested to an unprecedented 85% coverage!  Now you get operations
          and development collaborating to get it deployed, using tools they
          both understand.  Devops, right?
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet everyone is angry, frustrated and stressed.  The product fails to
          run when you deploy it, due to elementary issues.  It's slow.  The
          built-in fault tolerance doesn’t work.  Debugging the issues takes
          weeks.  Your one month to go-live turns into six months, and
          development and operations are ready to kill each other at the end.
          What went wrong?
        </p>

        <p>
          It went wrong on day one.  For the entire development cycle, every
          line of code in the application was exercised, but nobody ever ran the
          application.  If this scenario sounds familiar to you, come to this
          talk and learn why it happened, and how you can address it.

        <p>
          John Keiser is a veteran codeslayer of the internet age, having
          developed, tested and led teams at Netscape, Microsoft Bing, and now
          Chef for the last 20 years.  In his current role as Mad Scientist, he
          focuses on making provisioning and configuration easy enough that even
          *he* can do it.  If his secret lab exploded, he would leave behind a
          wife, three young kids, a large collection of video games, and a
          unicycle team.
