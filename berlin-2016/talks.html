          <h1>Spencer Krum : Code Review for Operations</h1>
<p>
Code review has been shown to help developers produce better code. It can also help operations teams run more reliable systems. Our ops team is fanatic about using code review and representing our infrastructure as code so that code review can be leveraged. In this presentation I will show how we use code review to manage our infrastructure, modify and create systems, administer services, etc. I'll discuss why we use code review for our operations work, and where we get value from it. I'll show the path we took to get here, what actions couldn't be piped through code review, and what we're going to next. I'll also dive into the human behaviors that I've seen emerge out of organizations that do this.

          <h1>Nathen Harvey : Beyond Infrastructure Automation</h1>
<p>We focus on our app code as the origin of business value. Anyone that's ever run apps in prod knows that no value is possible without the entire stack. DevOps has taught us to think about our app stacks holistically.  It's time we shift our thinking to an app-centric view of the world.

This talk will be an introduction to Habitat, the open source projects that let's use build, deploy, and manage applications.  The automation is part of and moves with the automation.

<p>
Nathen Harvey, VP of Community Development at Chef, helps the community whip up an awesome ecosystem built around the Chef platform. Nathen also spends much of his time helping people learn about the practices, processes, and technologies that support DevOps, continuous delivery, and high velocity organizations. Prior to joining Chef, Nathen spent a number of years managing operations and infrastructure for a diverse range of web applications.

          <h1>James Shubin : Next Generation Config Management</h1>
<p>
A presentation about a next gen config management tool, and the specific problems this project solves.

Three of the main design features of the tool include:
<ul>
<li> Parallel execution
<li> Event driven mechanism
<li> Distributed architecture
</ul>

This talk will demo a prototype I've built that implements these ideas and which is written in golang.
I will start by presenting an introduction to the tool.
I will then demo the new features that were added since the project was introduced. This will include the automatic grouping, automatic elastic etcd clustering and remote execution features.
I will finally share some of the future planned designs for the tool.

          <h1>Eric Sorenson : "Open Source, Open Communities: Maintainership and Contribution in 2016</h1>
<p>
Large open-source projects are changing the way they operate to reflect changes in maintainership and contribution patterns. Improvements in GitHub, test frameworks, and communication tools like chatops have made parts of OSS easier... and others way harder. In this talk, I'll walk through the evolution of our contribution and community processes on Puppet and its related projects over the last several years, to examine our successes -- and a few notable failures. I'll close with some ideas and suggestions, both to help maintainers improve the quality and quantity of their contributions, and to help both new and seasoned contributors have a great experience working on open-source projects.

          <h1>Ricardo Carrillo Cruz :  Ansible-based CI with Zuul </h1>
<p>
The OpenStack Infra team runs one of the world's largest and craziest
CI infrastructures. In service of our community, we have recently
replaced our fleet of Jenkins masters that were connected to Zuul v2
via a Gearman system with Zuul v3 and Ansible. In the process, we also
added a bunch of other fun features like support for static bare
metal, container orchestration engines and per-repo job config. If
replacing Jenkins with Ansible sounds crazy to you, that's cool - come
anyway and we'll see if we can't convince you it was a good idea. If
replacing Jenkins with Ansible sounds awesome, you're right - it is!
We can talk about all the super cool things we can do... and how you
can do them too.

          <h2>Felix Frank: mgmt and puppet - better together</h2>
<p>
One of the latest entries in the field of config management tools is mgmt (also known as mgmtconfig). It is in the alpha stage, and while most of its innovative features are available already, it still lacks its own programming language.
</p><p>

As a stop-gap, it is now possible to control the tool through Puppet manifests. This presentation shows how this works, highlighting the specific differences between the concepts of Puppet vs. mgmt.","Felix is a long-time core user of Puppet, has contributed a number of fixes and features, and wrote a beginner's title about the tool. Recently, he concentrated on the enhancements that allow Puppet to work closely with mgmt, as well as actual Go code for the new project itself.

<h2>Marco Ceppi : CTA: Share your operations </h2>
<p>
This is a call to arms. We need to stop thinking that the chef recipe or puppet script, playbook, etc makes your special. Your operations aren't special if you're the only one who can use this.

My talk is to press further on the idea that we need to start sharing with each other how to best setup kibana, hadoop, kubernetes, elastic search - and do this in a way that's truly resuable. In a way everyone benefits, including you.

<h2>Tim Meusel: Vox Pupuli - The Community behind puppet</h2>
<p>Vox Pupuli is a group of more than 70 puppet module/tooling/documentation authors, all working together to ensure a continuing development process. We recently elected our first Project Management Committee with one of its goals being to include Vox Pupuli as an official project under the Software Conservancy. We do not only provide a home for every orphaned puppet module, but also proper tooling and automation for every interested developer. Some of the most frequently used puppet modules (zabbix, collectd, archive, extlib) are managed by us. Have a look at our funny journey of hunting broken gems and changing upstream software! We invite everybody to participate.</p>
<p>About Tim:</p>
<p>Tim (bastelfreak) Meusel works as a Systems Engineer at the Host Europe Group in Cologne, Germany where he develops and maintains a big public cloud platform. Tim is pushing and implementing open source solutions at work. He founded the VirtAPI-Stack and besides that he is active as a Vox Pupuli Maintainer and Archlinux community manager. Tim has been doing Sysops stuff since 2009 and playing with Puppet since 2012. Recently he was elected to serve on the Vox Pupuli Project Management Committee. He enjoys good BBQ and ice hockey.</p>

<h2>George Miranda: The next phase of DevOps</h2>
<p>We've learned a great deal from DevOps and configuration management.  But if we look around the technology industry, we can see that a great change is about to occur.  Yet IT is lagging behind the curve.  Automation is moving into a new phase of ubiquitous adoption.  If we look at how everyone else approaches automation, it's not by simply repeating the same methods humans use in an automatic way.  As an IT industry, we need to re-examine our approach to automation in order fit into this new world.  In this ignite, we get a fast-paced dive into some of the questions and approaches we'll all be grappling with a lot sooner than we probably realize.</p>
<p>About George:</p>
<p>George Miranda is Director of Product Marketing and a Technical Evangelist with Chef Software.  He's made a career working in Web Operations for over 15 years at a variety of small dotcoms and large enterprises by obsessively automating every process he can. He is recovering from production ops PTSD and still twitches when dashboards turn red. He now spends his days figuring out ways to help others avoid the same fate by confronting the challenges we all face.  He enjoys his time living in the American Pacific Northwest, small batch artisanal whiskey, and writing conference biographies no one reads.
